TO answer the question WHERE AM I? I am using GeocoordinateWatcher class within .NET Framework to ask operating system About my GeoLocation.
Operating sytstem determine location and give estimate about location accuracy. It gives Lat Long information. This information is use to 
to create image of the current location. HERE location services and MAP  Image REST API is used to create image of curent location.
And give the map image I asked it to draw circle and uncertainty radius around the location. So Again based on GeocoordinateWatcher accuracy estimate 
. And this conclude the WHERE AM I. 

You should be able tro run this on your PC.

You need API key from HERE.com
